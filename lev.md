## What is it?

LEV is a story-driven 3D turn-based RPG with Rogue-lite mechanics where you play as Lev -- the main character. LEV takes place in a fictional world after the USSR and NATO countries entered into World War 3. The player is entered into a crime-riddled and grim-dark post-apocalytic world where very few resources are available outside of megacities.
